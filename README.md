# Demo Authentication Service

This repository contains a demonstration of an authentication service implementation in TypeScript. It showcases best practices for handling authentication, token refresh, and user management in a platform agnostic way.

## 🚨 Important Note

This is a **demo project** intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for implementing authentication in your own projects. It is not production-ready and should not be used as-is in a real-world application without thorough review and additional security measures.

## 🌟 Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Automatic token refresh
- Axios interceptors for handling authentication errors
- User state management
- TypeScript for type safety

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- `baseService.ts`: Contains the `Services` class, which handles core authentication logic.
- `userService.ts`: Extends `Services` to provide user-specific functionality.
- Unit tests for both services.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run tests: `npm test`

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Token Refresh

The service automatically handles token refresh when encountering 401 Unauthorized errors. This is implemented in the `handleResponseInterception` method of the `Services` base class.

### User State Management

The `UserService` class provides methods for fetching and caching user information, ensuring efficient data management.

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes unit tests for both the `Services` and `UserService` classes. These tests cover various scenarios including successful authentication, token refresh, and error handling. Since this is a demo, you can add any tests you like.

## 🛠️ Customization

To adapt this demo for your own projects:

1. Implement secure token storage (e.g., using encrypted local storage (MMKV/Keychain on mobile), or HTTP-only cookies).
2. Add additional security measures such as CSRF protection.
3. Customize the user data structure and API endpoints to match your backend.
4. Implement proper error handling and user feedback.
